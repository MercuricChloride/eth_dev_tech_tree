You'll use üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è HardHat to compile and deploy smart contracts. Then, you'll use a template React app full of important Ethereum components and hooks. Finally, you'll deploy an NFT to a public network to share with friends! üöÄ \n\n üåü The final deliverable is an app that lets users purchase and transfer NFTs.

          "ü¶∏ A superpower of Ethereum is allowing you, the builder, to create a simple set of rules that an adversarial group of players can use to work together. In this challenge, you create a decentralized application where users can coordinate a group funding effort. If the users cooperate, the money is collected in a second smart contract. If they defect, the worst that can happen is everyone gets their money back. The users only have to trust the code.\n\nüè¶ Build a Staker.sol contract that collects ETH from numerous addresses using a payable stake() function and keeps track of balances. After some deadline if it has at least some threshold of ETH, it sends it to an ExampleExternalContract and triggers the complete() action sending the full balance. If not enough ETH is collected, allow users to withdraw().\n\nüéõ Building the frontend to display the information and UI is just as important as writing the contract. The goal is to deploy the contract and the app to allow anyone to stake using your app. Use a Stake(address,uint256) event to all stakes.\n\nüåü The final deliverable is deploying a Dapp that lets users send ether to a contract and stake if the conditions are met, then yarn build and yarn surge your app to a public webserver.

This challenge will give you an example of a contract using block hash to create random numbers. This randomness is exploitable. Other, stronger forms of randomness include commit/reveal schemes, oracles, or VRF from Chainlink.\n\nüëç One day soon, randomness will be built into the Ethereum protocol!\n\nüí¨ Dice Game is a contract that allows users to roll the dice to try and win the prize. If players roll either a 0, 1, or 2 they will win the current prize amount. The initial prize is 10% of the contract's balance, which starts out at .05 Eth.\n\nüß§ Every time a player rolls the dice, they are required to send .002 Eth. 40 percent of this value is added to the current prize amount while the other 60 percent stays in the contract to fund future prizes. Once a prize is won, the new prize amount is set to 10% of the total balance of the DiceGame contract.\n\nüß® Your job is to attack the Dice Game contract! You will create a new contract that will predict the randomness ahead of time and only roll the dice when you're guaranteed to be a winner!",
